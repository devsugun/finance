FOR THE TRANSACTIONS PART***
You will need to create a table called "transactions" in your db with the number of fields input as 6 for the table. Then add six items like id, user_id, symbol, shares, price, and date. There are more things into it but I think I might need to share a youtube video for that as it's hard to explain like this.
